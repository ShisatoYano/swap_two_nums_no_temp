# swap_two_nums_no_temp

* Given two variables, x and y, swap two variables without using a third variables.  

1. get a sum in one of the two given numbers. The numbers can then be swapped using the sum and subtraction from the sum.  
2. multiplication and division can also be used for swapping.  
3. bitwise XOR operetor can be used to swap two variables.  

* In this sample code, a mixture of bitwise operators and arithmetic operators.
